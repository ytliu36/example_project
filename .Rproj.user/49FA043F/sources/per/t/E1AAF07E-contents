* `data/` will either be a symbolic link to an external data directory, or
a subdirectory
* `drafts/` will contain relevant paper drafts
* `literature/` will contain all references
* `results/` will contain results exported by the analysis files
* `source/` will contain bare scripts (typically containing functions sourced
by the full analysis files)
